# GM-Inspector
A tool for importing ground motion acceleration record files of different formats simply and intuitively. The properties of the ground motion can then be inspected through an interactive interface. This includes plots of the acceleration, velocity and displacement histories as well as the Fourier transformation and acceleration response spectrum. Additionally, other parameters are quantified such as the effective duration and filtered-incremental-velocity (FIV3).
